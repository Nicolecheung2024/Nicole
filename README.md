西北偏北/North by northwest

西北偏北，羊马很黑，你饮酒落泪；
西北偏北，把兰州喝醉，把兰州喝醉...
这是一首属于西北的诗，西北的底色就是悲凉壮阔，就像西北人的人生。

我要写一本属于我自己的“西北偏北”：西北偏北，天山巍峨挺立，穿越云霄直冲苍穹；祁连山绵延千里，雄伟的山峦如同巍峨的屏障，雪山巍峨草原壮阔。山顶常年积雪，每当阳光洒下，雪峰闪烁，犹如一颗颗闪耀的宝石镶嵌在高远的山巅。山间风声如歌，轻拂着高耸的峭壁，仿佛是大自然的交响乐。
西北偏北还有宛如失落的卫星的中亚五国，蒙古人在13世纪和14世纪曾在这里建立了很多汗国：金帐汗国、钦察汗国、窝阔台汗国、铁木尔汗国...
历史纵横上下千年，地理横跨欧亚大陆，所以我很需要用可视化地理来帮我完善我的地理知识，毕竟世界观的匮乏就是地理知识的匮乏导致的啊，我还想搭建一个属于我的“西北偏北”的网站，所以这就是为什么这个项目会在GitHub。

谨以此作品献给我爱的故乡。

North by northwest, where the sheep and horses roam beneath dark skies, where tears mingle with the drink;
North by northwest, get Lanzhou drunk, get Lanzhou drunk...
This is a poem that belongs to the northwest. The undertone of the northwest is tragic and majestic, just like the lives of its people.

I want to write my own "North by Northwest": North by northwest, the Tianshan Mountains stand tall and towering, crossing the clouds and reaching into the sky; the Qilian Mountains stretch for thousands of miles, the majestic mountains are like towering barriers, and the snow-capped mountains and majestic grasslands are magnificent. The top of the mountain is covered with snow all year round. Whenever the sun shines, the snow peaks sparkle, like shining gems inlaid on the top of the mountain. The wind in the mountains is like a song, gently blowing on the towering cliffs, like a symphony of nature.

There are also five Central Asian countries in the north-northwest that are like lost satellites. The Mongols established many khanates here in the 13th and 14th centuries: the Golden Horde, the Kipchak Khanate, the Ogedai Khanate, and the Ironwood Khanate. Erhanate...
With history spanning millennia and geography stretching across Eurasia, I find it essential to leverage visual geography to enhance my understanding of the world. I also want to build my own "North by Northwest" website, So This is why this project is on GitHub.

I would like to dedicate this book to my beloved hometown.
